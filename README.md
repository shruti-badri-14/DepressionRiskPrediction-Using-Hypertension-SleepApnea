# Optimise Diagnosis of Depression based on Hypertension and Sleep Apnea Factors

Analyzing sleep apnea and hypertension as indicators of depression risk is significant owing to their 
prevalent coexistence with depression. Determining the presence of these disorders as risk factors for depression
may facilitate early intervention, improving mental health outcomes and lessening the impact of depression.
Better treatment outcomes can be achieved by addressing the interconnected physical and mental health problems 
using this approach, which is in line with holistic healthcare. The project’s overall goal is to advance understanding
of these relationships, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and optimized interventions for affected individuals.

This study emphasizes how important it is to understand and consider the relationships between long-term medical
issues and mental health. Healthcare providers can identify high-risk patients and take prompt action by uncovering
underlying risk factors using data analytics. The correlations shown between depression categories and the poverty
income ratio indicate that socioeconomic status is a critical component of mental health and that initiatives targeted
at reducing poverty may potentially have a positive impact on mental health outcomes.

The project culminates by highlighting the significance of early detection and intervention and offering a comprehensive
perspective on depression in the setting of hypertension and sleep apnea. The study’s technique, which makes use of data
mining algorithms and large-scale datasets, establishes a backdrop for further mental health research. Future research will
concentrate on improving predictive models’ accuracy in a range of demographics and broadening their application to incorporate
more pertinent health factors.
